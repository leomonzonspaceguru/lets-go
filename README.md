# Go Web Application Development Guide

En este repositorio voy a abordar la creación de una aplicación rápida, segura, y mantenible siguiendo el libro Let's Go! 

1. **Server Fundamentals**
    - Starting a server, creating handlers, sending responses, routing requests, and serving static files.

2. **Structure and Organization**
    - Creating an idiomatic and scalable structure for your web application.

3. **Using Modules**
    - Leveraging Go's Module functionality for managing and version-controlling dependencies.

4. **Managing Configuration**
    - Using command-line flags and dependency injection to manage application settings.

5. **Logging and Error Handling**
    - Implementing leveled logging and centralized error handling.

6. **SQL Databases**
    - Designing a database model, setting up a connection pool, and executing statements and queries.

7. **HTML Templating**
    - Caching templates, displaying dynamic data, creating custom functions, and handling runtime errors.

8. **Middleware**
    - Creating custom middleware for common actions like logging requests and recovering panics.

9. **RESTful Routing**
    - Establishing a moqdern request routing structure following REST principles.

10. **Form Validation**
    - Implementing a reusable and user-friendly pattern for validating forms and displaying errors.

11. **Session Management**
    - Using and configuring sessions to persist data between requests.

12. **Using HTTPS**
    - Correctly setting up an HTTPS server and configuring it for improved performance and security.

13. **Embedding Files**
    - Embedding static assets (HTML templates, images, CSS, and JS files) into your Go binary.

14. **Preventing Common Vulnerabilities**
    - Strategies to prevent SQL injection, CSRF, XSS, clickjacking, and slow-client attacks.

15. **Authentication and Authorization**
    - Safely encrypting user passwords and adding signup, login, and logout functionality.

16. **Request Context**
    - Using Go's `context.Context` to pass data between middleware and handlers.

17. **Testing**
    - Creating unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, mocking dependencies, and measuring test coverage.

18. **Putting It All Together**
    - Building a fully-functioning Go web application.
